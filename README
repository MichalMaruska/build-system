* Background:

git-dch passes (not a simple mapping) only *some* params to
debchange/dch.
Dch employes a heuristics to do stuff.

So it's difficult to build on a low-level tool, which does heuristics
for itself.

So, that Perl code should be treated as a library, git-dch should
build on top of that (again in Perl, I'm sorry).



* Features

*** snap

** When making a package (source or preparing for compilation)
I want to generate all the "autoconf" generated files.
So that I don't have to store configure .... install.sh
and similar files in Git.

** debian/control ....support for generation from the *.in file.

** making a Snapshot package does NOT make a commit.
So the debian/changelog is not submitted, but still changed.

git-buildpackage does not do that out-of-box. a pre-build hook is
necessary.


*** release

** I want an option to switch to git-builder.  todo!
** I want to dictate the Distro name on command line.  how?



* History
** First I had my PPA on lauchpad

** git-buildpackage ... I had a recipe, and pasted on Zsh command line.

** Then I automated this: I had a function zload-file which pushed on
the "stack" the commands (builtin print -z $line), so they would
auto-magically appear in sequence, when you press Enter.

I made a wrapper mygit-buildpackage which invoked some hooks, when
necessary.


** Then, upgrading to yet another ubuntu release,
I made Perl tools for debian/{control,changelog} parsing, so that I
could somehow rebuild all my packages for that distro. ... still in progress

** Then I wanted to build inside ...  pbuilder -> git-builder (cow-worker)

** Then I noticed how to make "snapshot" package.
** At the same time I installed mini-dinstall, and after 2 weeks reprepro.

*** release 1.0


** soon mygit-buildpackage, which was just to invoke the prototype hooks,
will not be needed:  snap is enough?
